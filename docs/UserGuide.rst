Introduction

------------

- Aakash School Education is committed to offering the students free access to its many academic resources. We seek to capitalize on the potential of the internet to eliminate borders and geographic distance as obstacles to the instantaneous exchange of knowledge and new ideas. Unlike distance learning programs that charge tuition, provide formal instruction and limit participation, we offer all course materials free to everyone with online access. People from around the world may upload their content and students can make use of our extensive library of content, including interactive challenges, assessments, and videos from any computer with access to the web. ASE does not require any registration and is not a degree-granting or certificate-granting activity rather it is instead an effort to share knowledge and make sure the students have access to world class education content making full use of the Internet's potential.

- The main purpose of creating web Application is to initialize task,it is an important part of the process. It requires putting together the Web Application project goals and purpose.

- Defining Web Application, Purpose, Goals and Direction establishes your project's clear direction and helps you focus on setting and achieving your goal. 

**Why Python-Django**

- Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles.Python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a programmable interface.

- Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.Django was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements of the experienced Web developers who wrote it. It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.

*Advantage of using python over other programming languages*

- Python programs run slower than the Java codes, but python saves much time ans space. Python programs are 3-5 times smaller than 
  java prog's.

- The elegant design and syntax rules of this programming language make it quite readable even among the multi programmer 
  development teams.

**GIT**

- GIT stands for Graphical Interactive Tool.

- GitHub is now the largest online storage space of collaborative works that exists in the world. 

- Git is version control software, which means it manages changes to a project without overwriting any part of that project.

- If you and a coworker are both updating pages on the same website. You make your changes, save them, and upload them back to the 
  website. So far, so good. The problem comes when your coworker is working on the same page as you at the same time. One of you is 
  about to have your work overwritten and erased.
  A version control application like Git keeps that from happening.

- You and your coworker can each upload your revisions to the same page, and Git will save two copies. Later, you can merge your 
  changes together without losing any work along the way.

**GNU/Linux**

- GNU is a Unix-like computer operating system developed by the GNU Project. It is composed wholly of free software. It is based on the GNU Hurd kernel and is intended to be a "complete Unix-compatible software system".

- The system's basic components include the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), the GNU C library (glibc), and GNU Core Utilities (coreutils), but also the GNU Debugger (GDB), GNU Binary Utilities (binutils),the bash shell and the GNOME desktop environment. 

- The GNU Project has endorsed variants using the Linux kernel, such as gNewSense, Trisquel and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.

- LINUX is also a Unix-like and mostly POSIX-compliant computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open source software development and distribution.

-  The underlying source code may be used, modified, and distributed—commercially or non-commercially—by anyone under licenses such as the GNU General Public License.

- Typically, Linux is packaged in a format known as a Linux distribution for desktop and server use. Some popular mainstream Linux distributions include Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, Arch Linux, and the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. 

- Linux distributions include the Linux kernel, supporting utilities and libraries and usually a large amount of application software to fulfill the distribution's intended use.

- The open-source software movement arose to clarify the environment that the new copyright, licensing, domain, and consumer issues created.

- Open-source code is typically a collaborative effort where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community so that other members can help improve it further.

- Distros designed to replace your existing operating system some othere linux distros are Ubuntu,OpenSUSE,Fedora etc.

- Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating system, with Unity as its default desktop environment (GNOME was the previous desktop environment).Ubuntu is the most popular desktop Linux distribution.

- The Ubuntu project is publicly committed to the principles of open source development; people are encouraged to use free software, study how it works, improve upon it, and distribute it.
