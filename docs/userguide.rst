Introduction
------------

- Aakash School Education is committed to offering the students free
  access to its many academic resources. We seek to capitalize on the
  potential of the internet to eliminate borders and geographic
  distance as obstacles to the instantaneous exchange of knowledge and
  new ideas. Unlike distance learning programs that charge tuition,
  provide formal instruction and limit participation, we offer all
  course materials free to everyone with online access. People from
  around the world may upload their content and students can make use
  of our extensive library of content, including interactive
  challenges, assessments, and videos from any computer with access to
  the web. ASE does not require any registration and is not a
  degree-granting or certificate-granting activity rather it is
  instead an effort to share knowledge and make sure the students have
  access to world class education content making full use of the
  Internets potential.

- The main purpose of creating web Application is to initialize
  task,it is an important part of the process. It requires putting
  together the Web Application project goals and purpose.

- Defining Web Application, Purpose, Goals and Direction establishes
  your project's clear direction and helps you focus on setting and
  achieving your goal.
 
**Why Python-Django**

- Python is a very-high-level dynamic object-oriented programming
  language.It’s designed to be easy to learn, read and program.

- Python is open.

  - Python is open source software, distributed under a liberal
    license, and can thus be distributed freely.

- Python is general purpose.

  - Python is a general purpose language, which means that many things
    are made easy. Examples are string processing, reading/writing
    files, sockets, websites, databases, GUI’s.

- Python is dynamic.

  - Being a dynamic language means that new code can be executed
    during run time without limitations.

- Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid
  development and clean, pragmatic design.

- Django was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive
  deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements of the
  experienced Web developers who wrote it.

- Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex,
  database-driven websites. Django emphasizes reusability and
  "pluggability" of components, rapid development.

- Django follows the model–view–controller architectural pattern.Lets
  dive into what is MVC Design Pattern.The first thing to note is that
  that we split it over four Python files (models.py, views.py,
  urls.py) and an HTML template (latest_uploads.html): ::

	# models.py (the database tables)

	from django.db import models

	class Subject(models.Model):
	    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
	    upload_date = models.DateField()


	# views.py (the business logic)

	from django.shortcuts import render
	from models import Subject

	def latest_uploads(request):
	    uploads_list = Subject.objects.order_by('-upload_date')[:10]
	    return render(request, 'latest_uploads.html', {'uploads_list': uploads_list})


	# urls.py (the URL configuration)

	from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
	import views

	urlpatterns = patterns('',
	    (r'^latest/$', views.latest_uploads),
	)


	# latest_uploads.html (the template)

	<html><head><title>Uploads</title></head>
	<body>
	<h1>Uploads</h1>
	<ul>
	{% for uploads in uploads_list %}
	<li>{{ uploads.name }}</li>
	{% endfor %}
	</ul>
	</body></html>  
 
 Advantage of using python over other programming languages

- Python programs run slower than the Java codes, but python saves
  much time and space. Python programs are 3-5 times smaller than java
  programs.

- Python is dynamic typed language. Python programmers don't need to
  waste time in declaring variable types as in java.

- The program length in python is 5-10 times shorter than that in C++.

- Unlike other programming languages python code has to be strictly
  indented but the indentation helps in much cleaner code(readable).

- High level data structures are list, directory are well suited in
  python.

- The elegant design and syntax rules of this programming language
  make it quite readable even among the multi programmer development
  teams.
    

**GIT**
 
- GIT stands for Graphical Interactive Tool.

- GitHub is now the largest online storage space of collaborative
  works that exists in the world.

- Git is version control software, which means it manages changes to a
  project without overwriting any part of that project.

- If you and a coworker are both updating pages on the same
  website. You make your changes, save them, and upload them back to
  the website. So far, so good. The problem comes when your coworker
  is working on the same page as you at the same time. One of you is
  about to have your work overwritten and erased.  A version control
  application like Git keeps that from happening.

- You and your coworker can each upload your revisions to the same
  page, and Git will save two copies. Later, you can merge your
  changes together without losing any work along the way.

**GNU/Linux**

- GNU is a Unix-like computer operating system developed by the GNU
  Project. It is composed wholly of free software. It is based on the
  GNU Hurd kernel and is intended to be a "complete Unix-compatible
  software system".

- The system's basic components include the GNU Compiler Collection
  (GCC), the GNU C library (glibc), and GNU Core Utilities
  (coreutils), but also the GNU Debugger (GDB), GNU Binary Utilities
  (binutils),the bash shell and the GNOME desktop environment.

- The GNU Project has endorsed variants using the Linux kernel, such
  as gNewSense, Trisquel and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.

- LINUX is also a Unix-like and mostly POSIX-compliant computer
  operating system assembled under the model of free and open source
  software development and distribution.

- The underlying source code may be used, modified, and
  distributed—commercially or non-commercially—by anyone under
  licenses such as the GNU General Public License.

- Typically, Linux is packaged in a format known as a Linux
  distribution for desktop and server use. Some popular mainstream
  Linux distributions include Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, Arch
  Linux, and the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux
  Enterprise Server.

- Linux distributions include the Linux kernel, supporting utilities
  and libraries and usually a large amount of application software to
  fulfill the distribution's intended use.

- The open-source software movement arose to clarify the environment
  that the new copyright, licensing, domain, and consumer issues
  created.

- Open-source code is typically a collaborative effort where
  programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes
  within the community so that other members can help improve it
  further.

- Distros designed to replace your existing operating system some
  other linux distros are Ubuntu,OpenSUSE,Fedora etc.

- Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating system, with Unity as its
  default desktop environment (GNOME was the previous desktop
  environment).Ubuntu is the most popular desktop Linux distribution.

- The Ubuntu project is publicly committed to the principles of open
  source development; people are encouraged to use free software,
  study how it works, improve upon it, and distribute it.

 
Description
-----------


Workflow
~~~~~~~~

- A model is the single, definitive source of information about your
  data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data
  you’re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database
  table.Each attribute of the model represents a database field.

 *In this website there are various fields they are:*

- Class: describes which class the student belongs to. Based on the
  class, the student accesses the study materials.The study materials
  are viewed by the teacher and a remark is given. Administrator
  stores number of classes in the database so that user can contribute
  or review on a particular class.

- Comment: The comments are given by the reviewer based on the topic
  of the subject. The date on which the comments are submitted are
  also noted along with the reviewer name.

- Topic: The user should mention the particular topic of the selected
  subject. The topic is stored in the database.
   - Every user who logs in must be either a user or contributor or
     reviewer.
   - If the person who logs in, is a user he can just see the
     materials but cannot modify the data. He can see the comments
     given by the reviewers but can not comment.
   - If the person who logs in, is a contributor he will be given
     permission to upload different formats of the files. The
     contributor can see the comments given by the reviewers.
   - If the person who logs in, is a reviewer he will be given
     permission to review the uploaded files of the contributor and
     comment on the uploaded files.
   - Reviewer is the specialized person in the subject and as a
     reviewer he doesn't have the right to upload any files.
   - An upload will be available to the user if and only if it is
     approved by atleast 3 reviewers.
   - The user searches the study materials based on the class
     number,subject and topic.
   - The user may download either pdf,video or animation materials.

- Contact: Non-user can give the suggestions based on the different
  uploads done by the contributor. He/she can send their name,email id
  and message in order to modify changes in uploads. What ever the
  message sent by the non-user will be seen by administrator and if
  administrator accepts it then further modifications are done on the
  uploads.

- Contributor: A contributor can sign up by filling their name,
  contact, picture and validation-docs in the registration form. Now
  the administrator will check the details of contributor and if the
  access permissions are granted then they can upload any file
  formats. Here the access permissions are given to contributor by
  admin based on the capabilities of validation-docs.

- Reviewer: A reviewer can sign up by filling their name, contact and
  picture in the registration form. Now the administrator will check
  the details of reviewer and if the access permissions are granted
  then they can comment on the uploaded files.

- FAQ: FAQ consists of fields like questions and answers. It describes
  the frequently asked questions and answers by users.

- Language: Users can download or view the files in three different
  languages.

- Subject: A contributor can upload the file that should have name,
  topic, class-name and that file can be in pdf, video, animation
  formats. Rating can be given by administrator based on the
  capabilities of contributor upload.

Interface
~~~~~~~~~

**User Interface**

 User Interface for the "WebPortal" application begins with the
 homepage of the portal, showing the recent uploads, number of
 classes,subjects and uploads. It also have links to the Contact Us,
 Content, Register(dropdown of contributor/reviewer), Login and more
 pages which includes a dropdown of the Docs, About us and details of
 the users.  Once a person is logged in, the login button changes to
 his username and a dropdown comes on clicking his username, which
 takes him to his profile or enables him to logout.

Conclusion
----------

- Students are given the opportunity to choose from various subjects
  and topics so that they can gain more knowledge. This is especially
  beneficial for those who live in rural areas that only have one or
  two educational facilities, which most of the time, offer limited
  course and program options for students.

- Another benefit of taking online tutorials, and probably the most
  popular one, would be that it offers flexibility to
  students. Because they can attend classes and courses whenever and
  wherever there is a computer and access to the internet, they can
  easily plan out a schedule that would work for them.

- Online learning allows a more student-centered teaching
  approach. Because every student has his or her way of learning that
  works for them, getting an online education may help in ensuring
  that each lesson or material is completely understood before moving
  on to the next, which in turn, could result to better learning.

- Online course materials can be accessed 24 hours a day every
  day. This means that students can easily read and review lectures,
  discussions and other materials relevant to their subjects. There
  are some students who find it a bit difficult to understand spoken
  material in a typical classroom setting because of a number of
  distractions, boredom or tiredness. Because they can simply access
  the material online once they are prepared to learn, students are
  able to take in and understand the material a lot better.

- Because of the flexibility offered by online learning, not only
  undergraduate students, but also individuals who already have
  full-time jobs or other commitments are able to take supplementary
  courses and even earn their college degrees online.
